TemperatureSender.py:						|WebServer:
Client program that sends temperature in format of 		|After user successfully logedin read temperature for every 60 seconds
"aquariumId,hash_name,temperature".				|and show it to user on web.
But it will be encrypted with using hash_name as a salt.	|Create object on html for video and give aquariums ip to it
For making it easy for server(And we dont have that much of time|As an example 'http://158.108.34.18:8081'
for another good approach) this script will add hash_name in the|
 middle of encrypted text.					|
Like:								|
'GfdVTVHeQa8Y7fZ72IPnbKM=' this is example of encrypted command |
of '11,comar,2'. 						|
*'11' is aquarium id   						|
*'bencomar' is hash_name					|
*'2' is command							|
Lets add the hash_name in the middle of the string.		|
'GfdVTVHeQa8Ybencomar7fZ72IPnbKM='				|
hash_name must be 8 characters all the time and encrypted string|
will contain 32 characters.It will be sended on port 1234	|
								|
ListenCommands.py:						|
Server program that listens port 1235 for incoming bytes.Use	|
decyrption function for understand the command.It will be form	|
of 'userId,hash_name,commandId'.				|
Verify the user with txt file called aquarium.txt if user has	|
right to do it commit the command				|
								|
VideoStreaming:							|
This is the service called motion.It can easly loaded from	|
internet with "sudo apt-get install motion" after little conf	|
settings "sudo service motion start" command will start the 	|
service of streaming.And it can be reached from port 8081.	|
